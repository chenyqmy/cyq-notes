Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation explains how every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force that is proportional to the product of their masses, and inversely proportional to the square of their distance apart

where _F_ is the force between two masses _m_1 and _m_2, _G_ is the gravitational constant (6.674 × 10−11 m3/kg per s2), and _r_ is the distance between the centres of the masses (Fig. 3.1).

In the case of the Earth-Moon system, the Earth and Moon orbit each other about their common centre of gravity, and so the gravitational attraction is balanced by the outward directed centrifugal force1 (Fig. 3.2). Because the mass of the Earth is two orders of magnitude greater than the mass of the Moon, the centre of gravity of the Earth-Moon system actually lies within the body of the Earth; indeed, it is around 1700 km below the surface of the Earth. The Earth-Moon system turns about this centre of gravity once per month, and so every object on Earth turns with it. The centrifugal force (the dashed arrow directed outward from the Earth on Fig. 3.2) is the same everywhere, because all points on Earth experience the same [orbital motion](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/orbital-motion "Learn more about orbital motion from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). However, the gravitational attraction of the Moon is progressively weaker as we move away from the Moon, as stated by Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation (Eq. 3.1). The result is that the centrifugal force and the Moon’s gravity cannot balance each other everywhere. The slight imbalances that occur are what cause the tides in the ocean. These imbalances are called the _tide generating forces_.

At the centre of the Earth (Fig. 3.3), the centrifugal force (dashed arrow) is equal and opposite to the Moon’s [gravitational pull](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/gravitational-pull "Learn more about gravitational pull from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (solid arrow). At point _A_ (position on the Earth’s surface closest to the Moon), the Moon’s gravity exceeds the centrifugal force, and this results in a net force towards the Moon (block arrow at _A_). At point _B_ (position on the Earth’s surface furthest from the Moon), the Moon’s gravity is weaker than the centrifugal force. This results in a net force directed away from the moon at _B_ (block arrow at _B_).
